name: "Red-Team an AI Deployment (aine-responsible-ai)"
description: "Run a structured red-team exercise against a deployed AI workload. Covers prompt injection, jailbreak, data exfiltration, and adversarial input attacks. Produces a findings report and remediation plan."
trigger: command
phrase: "/redteam"
---


## Objective

Demonstrate, through documented attempts, where the deployed workload's safety controls fail. The output is not "we passed the red team" - it is "here is what an attacker can do, here is what we caught, here is what we missed."

## Procedure

1. **Scope the engagement.** Workload, environment (prod / staging / sandbox), allowed attack types, time-box, escalation path if a real vulnerability is found.
2. **Threat model.** Identify attacker classes (curious user, motivated insider, external attacker with API access). Identify high-value targets (PII, model weights, downstream system access).
3. **Run the attack catalogue.** At minimum:
   - **Prompt injection**: direct, indirect (poisoned context), tool-use chain hijack
   - **Jailbreak**: persona, hypothetical, encoding bypass, multi-turn priming
   - **Data exfiltration**: prompt-extraction, training-data extraction, system-prompt leak
   - **Adversarial input**: typos that flip classification, low-perturbation evasion
   - **Tool abuse** (for agentic systems): unbounded action, authorization bypass, output-of-scope
4. **Capture every attempt.** Successful, partially successful, blocked. Include the exact input, the response, the trace through any guardrail.
5. **Score severity.** Critical (immediate exfil or harm), high (broken guardrail), medium (degraded behaviour), low (cosmetic). Severity is the impact, not the difficulty.
6. **Recommend remediations.** Per finding: input filter rule, output filter rule, system-prompt change, model swap, kill-switch. Time-bound owner.
7. **Re-test after remediation.** Don't sign off until every critical and high finding is fixed and re-tested.

## Done when

- The report enumerates every attack attempted and the result.
- Every critical / high finding has a named, time-bound remediation.
- A re-test cycle has been scheduled.
- The product owner and the AppSec team have signed off.

## Anti-patterns

- "We tested 100 prompts and found nothing" - report what you tested, with examples, even when you find nothing. A clean run is also evidence.
- Running red-team in prod without explicit kill-switch and customer notification.
- Treating red-team as compliance theatre. The report goes to engineering, not to a binder.
