## How to Use Industry Verticals

1. **Check if your industry has a pre-built sample** — Start from existing code, not scratch
2. **Identify compliance requirements** — Each industry has specific regulations
3. **Layer industry patterns on top of core AINE layers** — The vertical doesn't replace layers; it adds domain-specific configuration
4. **Use industry-specific guardrails** — Denied topics, required disclaimers, compliance language

## Industry-Specific Guardrail Examples

```python
# Healthcare
topics_config=[
    {"name": "MedicalAdvice", "definition": "Providing specific medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations", "type": "DENY"},
    {"name": "DrugPrescription", "definition": "Recommending specific medications or dosages", "type": "DENY"},
]

# Financial Services
topics_config=[
    {"name": "InvestmentAdvice", "definition": "Providing specific investment recommendations or guarantees", "type": "DENY"},
    {"name": "CreditDecision", "definition": "Making final credit approval or denial decisions without human review", "type": "DENY"},
]

# Insurance
topics_config=[
    {"name": "CoverageGuarantee", "definition": "Guaranteeing coverage or claim approval before review", "type": "DENY"},
    {"name": "LegalAdvice", "definition": "Providing legal counsel about claim disputes", "type": "DENY"},
]
```
