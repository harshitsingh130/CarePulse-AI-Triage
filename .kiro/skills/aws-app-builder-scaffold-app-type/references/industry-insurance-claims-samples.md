## Recommended Starting Points

**For a quick prototype (< 1 hour):**
→ Use the Strands Agent pattern from `strands-agent-implementation.md` + `agentcore deploy`

**For a managed agent (< 1 day):**
→ Follow the [Insurance Claim Lifecycle blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/automate-the-insurance-claim-lifecycle-using-amazon-bedrock-agents-and-knowledge-bases/) and deploy the CloudFormation stack

**For enterprise production (weeks):**
→ Use the [Omnichannel Claims Processing Guidance](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-omnichannel-claims-processing-powered-by-generative-ai-on-aws) as a foundation and customize
