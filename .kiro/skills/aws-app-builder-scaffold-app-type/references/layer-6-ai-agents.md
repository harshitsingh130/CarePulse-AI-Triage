# Layer 6 — AI Agents

## Purpose

Multi-agentic autonomous execution. This is the intelligence layer — where AI agents are built, configured with tools, connected to knowledge, and orchestrated together. **Strongest layer at 95% coverage.**

## Coverage: 95% (Excellent — 30+ samples across both catalogs)

## Deep-dive: Deploying agents on AWS

**Reference material in this engagement** (no Docker, no repository required):

- `deployment-agentcore-overview.md` — decision guide: AgentCore CLI vs Starter Toolkit, deployment modes (direct code deploy, container via CodeBuild), 10 production gotchas, troubleshooting, security checklist
- `deployment-agentcore-cli.md` — `agentcore create / dev / deploy / invoke` workflow with framework selection, hot reload, project templates
- `deployment-agentcore-services.md` — full inventory of AgentCore services: Runtime, Memory, Gateway, Code Interpreter, Browser, Observability, Evaluation, Identity, Policy — with selection criteria
- `deployment-agentcore-starter-toolkit.md` — Python `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` walkthrough including IaC generation (CDK/Terraform), local testing, programmatic invocation

guardrail = bedrock.CfnGuardrail(self, "AppGuardrail",
    name="app-guardrail",
    blocked_input_messaging="I cannot process that request.",
    blocked_output_messaging="I cannot provide that information.",
    content_policy_config=bedrock.CfnGuardrail.ContentPolicyConfigProperty(
        filters_config=[
            {"type": "HATE", "input_strength": "HIGH", "output_strength": "HIGH"},
            {"type": "VIOLENCE", "input_strength": "HIGH", "output_strength": "HIGH"},
        ]
    ),
    sensitive_information_policy_config=bedrock.CfnGuardrail.SensitiveInformationPolicyConfigProperty(
        pii_entities_config=[
            {"type": "EMAIL", "action": "ANONYMIZE"},
            {"type": "PHONE", "action": "ANONYMIZE"},
            {"type": "US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER", "action": "BLOCK"},
        ]
    ),
)
```

## Agent Design Principles

1. **Single responsibility** — Each agent should do one thing well
2. **Clear tool descriptions** — LLM selects tools based on docstrings; be precise
3. **Fail gracefully** — Tools should return error dicts, not raise exceptions
4. **Human escalation** — Always have an escape hatch for edge cases
5. **Guardrails always on** — Never deploy without content filtering
6. **Session management** — Use AgentCore Memory for multi-turn context
7. **Evaluation before production** — Test with diverse inputs, measure quality

## Advanced Agent Patterns (from Agentic Catalog)

### Reflection Pattern (Agentic #22)

Agent reviews and self-corrects its own output before returning:

```python
# Agent generates response → reviews it → corrects if needed
REFLECTION_PROMPT = """Review your previous response for:
1. Factual accuracy (grounded in retrieved data)
2. Completeness (all user questions answered)
3. Tone (professional, empathetic)
If issues found, provide a corrected response. If acceptable, return as-is."""
```

Reference: https://builder.aws.com/content/2zo16pNcEvQHtHpwSa...

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol (Agentic #24)

Standard protocol for agents to communicate with each other across systems:

```python
# Agent A calls Agent B via A2A protocol on AgentCore Runtime
# Enables cross-team, cross-framework agent collaboration
```

### Computer Use / Browser Automation (Agentic #30)

Agent controls a browser to interact with web applications:

```python
# Bedrock Agents Computer Use — automate web-based workflows
# Use case: Fill forms, extract data from legacy web apps, test UIs
```

### Dynamic Inline Agents (Agentic #31)

Configure agent behavior at runtime without redeployment:

```python
# Create agent configuration dynamically based on user role/context
# Useful for multi-tenant apps where each tenant has different rules
```

### Custom Orchestrator (Agentic #32)

Build custom routing logic instead of using default orchestration:

```python
# Override default ReAct loop with custom decision logic
# Useful when you need deterministic routing for certain inputs
```

### Agent SOP — Standard Operating Procedures (Agentic #46)

Structure agent behavior around documented SOPs:

```python
# Agent follows step-by-step procedures from SOP documents
# Combines RAG (retrieve SOP) + structured execution
```

Reference: https://github.com/strands-agents/agent-sop

### Durable Agent Workflows — Temporal + Strands (Agentic #113)

Agent workflows that survive failures and can resume:

```python
# Temporal provides durable execution guarantees
# Agent state persists across crashes, timeouts, deployments
# Use for long-running multi-step processes (claims, onboarding)
```

## Build Checklist

- [ ] Choose agent framework (Strands, Bedrock Agents, or multi-framework)
- [ ] Define system prompt with clear role, capabilities, and rules
- [ ] Implement tools with proper type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Add guardrails (content filtering + PII protection)
- [ ] Set up Knowledge Base for RAG (if needed)
- [ ] Implement session/memory management
- [ ] Add human escalation path for edge cases
- [ ] Test with diverse inputs and edge cases
- [ ] Set up evaluation metrics

## Common Mistakes

1. **Vague system prompts** — Be specific about what the agent can/cannot do
2. **Tools without error handling** — Every tool should catch exceptions and return error dicts
3. **No token limits** — Set max_tokens to prevent runaway responses
4. **Missing guardrails** — Always deploy with content filtering enabled
5. **No evaluation** — Test with adversarial inputs before production
6. **Monolithic agent** — Split into specialized agents if handling >5 distinct tasks
