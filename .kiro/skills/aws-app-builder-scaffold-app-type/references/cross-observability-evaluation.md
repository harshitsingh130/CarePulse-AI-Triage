# ⬡ Cross-Cutting — Observability & Evaluation

## Purpose

Monitor agent performance, evaluate quality, track costs, and detect anomalies across all layers. Essential for production AI applications.

## Coverage: 85% (Strong — 6 observability options, evaluation tools mature)

## Capabilities

### 1. Agent Observability

**Coverage:** ✅ Both (Accel #30 + Agentic #93-98)

| Langfuse (AgentCore integration) | https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-11-04-amazon-bedrock-agentcore |
| Datadog Integration | Available via ADOT |
| Grafana Integration | Available via ADOT |
| One Observability Demo | https://github.com/aws-samples/one-observability-demo |

**6 observability options:**

| Tool | Best For | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| AgentCore Observability | Agents on AgentCore Runtime | Automatic (zero config) |
| CloudWatch GenAI | Any agent (Strands, LangGraph, CrewAI) | ADOT SDK instrumentation |
| Langfuse | Detailed prompt/response logging, cost tracking | AgentCore integration or self-hosted |
| Datadog | Teams already using Datadog | ADOT exporter |
| Grafana | Custom dashboards, open-source | ADOT exporter |
| CloudWatch Dashboards | Simple, native AWS | Custom metrics + dashboard |

**CloudWatch GenAI setup (ADOT):**

```python
# For agents on AgentCore Runtime — automatic, no code needed

# For agents on Lambda/ECS — add ADOT SDK
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter()))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
```

**Key metrics to track:**
- Agent response latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Tool invocation success/failure rate
- Token usage per request
- Guardrail block rate
- Error rate by error type
- Session duration and turn count

**Evaluation dimensions:**

| Dimension | What It Measures | Tool |
|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Task completion | Did the agent achieve the goal? | AgentCore Evals, Strands Evals |
| Tool accuracy | Did it call the right tools with right params? | Strands Evals |
| Response quality | Is the response helpful, accurate, complete? | LLM-as-judge |
| RAG relevance | Are retrieved documents relevant? | RAGAS, Bedrock KB Eval |
| RAG faithfulness | Is the response grounded in retrieved docs? | RAGAS, Bedrock KB Eval |
| Safety | Does it avoid harmful content? | Guardrails metrics |
| Latency | Is response time acceptable? | CloudWatch metrics |

**Evaluation in CI/CD:**

```python
# Run as part of CI pipeline
from strands.eval import evaluate

results = evaluate(
    agent=my_agent,
    test_cases=[
        {"input": "File a claim for car accident", "expected_tools": ["lookup_policy", "create_claim"]},
        {"input": "What's my claim status?", "expected_tools": ["get_claim_status"]},
    ],
    metrics=["tool_accuracy", "response_quality"],
)

assert results.tool_accuracy > 0.9
assert results.response_quality > 0.8
```

### 6. Cost Governance & Token Budgets

**Coverage:** 🟠 Partial (Accel #18 + Agentic #59, #94)

| Resource | Link |
|----------|------|
| CloudWatch GenAI (token metrics) | Built into CloudWatch GenAI Observability |
| AWS Cost Explorer | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.html |

**Cost tracking approach:**
- Track tokens per request via CloudWatch custom metrics
- Set billing alarms on Bedrock spend
- Use CloudWatch GenAI for per-agent cost breakdown
- Implement token budgets per user/session (custom logic)

**Gap:** No token budget enforcement tool exists. Must build custom:

```python
# Custom token budget check
MAX_TOKENS_PER_SESSION = 50000

@tool
def check_token_budget(session_id: str) -> dict:
    """Check remaining token budget for this session."""
    used = get_session_token_count(session_id)
    remaining = MAX_TOKENS_PER_SESSION - used
    if remaining <= 0:
        return {"error": "Token budget exceeded", "used": used}
    return {"remaining": remaining, "used": used}
```

### 7. Production Cost Projection

**Coverage:** 🔴 TRUE GAP

No tool exists to extrapolate PoC usage to production-scale cost estimates.

**Custom build recommendation:**
1. Collect token usage metrics during PoC (per request type)
2. Multiply by projected production volume
3. Factor in: model costs, Lambda invocations, DynamoDB reads/writes, S3 storage
4. Build a calculator that takes PoC metrics + projected users → monthly cost estimate

## Build Checklist

- [ ] Enable AgentCore Observability or CloudWatch GenAI
- [ ] Set up key metrics dashboards (latency, errors, tokens, cost)
- [ ] Implement agent evaluation suite (run in CI)
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch alarms (error rate, latency, cost)
- [ ] Set up anomaly detection on key metrics
- [ ] Track token usage per user/session
- [ ] Set billing alarms on Bedrock spend
- [ ] Plan evaluation cadence (daily/weekly automated runs)
- [ ] Document SLOs (response time, accuracy, availability)

## Common Mistakes

1. **No observability until production** — Instrument from day 1; debugging blind is painful
2. **Only tracking errors** — Also track latency, token usage, and quality metrics
3. **No evaluation baseline** — Establish quality metrics before making changes
4. **Ignoring cost until the bill arrives** — Set billing alarms immediately
5. **Manual evaluation only** — Automate evaluation in CI; manual doesn't scale
