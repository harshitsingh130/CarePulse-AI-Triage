name: "Advance to AI-DLC Construction (aine-aws-aidlc)"
description: "Pre-flights that Inception is complete and AINE intake is synced, then activates AI-DLC's Construction phase. Construction produces functional / NFR / infrastructure design and code under AI-DLC's per-unit loop."
trigger: command
phrase: "/aidlc-construction"

## Objective

Activate AI-DLC's Construction phase. AI-DLC's rules drive the per-unit loop (Functional Design â†’ NFR Requirements â†’ NFR Design â†’ Infrastructure Design â†’ Code Generation), then Build and Test. AINE's role is to provide layer references on demand and to record the AINE-side decision.

## Pre-flight

1. **Verify AI-DLC is installed.** Per `aidlc-aine-bridge.md` detection. If not, refuse with a pointer to `/aidlc-install`.
2. **Verify Inception is complete.**
   - `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/**` must exist.
   - AI-DLC `aidlc-state.md` must show the Inception phase as approved.
   - If either fails: refuse with "Inception is not complete. Run `/aidlc-inception` first."
3. **Verify AINE intake is synced.** `state.intake.discoveryComplete === true`. If false: tell the FDE "Run `/aidlc-sync` first to mirror AI-DLC requirements into AINE intake."
4. **Verify state stage.** `currentStage` should be `intent` or `assess`. Construction work belongs to the `transform` stage â€” entering it advances the stage.

## Procedure

1. Tell the FDE: "I will hand off to AI-DLC's Construction phase. AI-DLC walks per-unit Functional Design, NFR Requirements, NFR Design, Infrastructure Design, and Code Generation, with explicit user-confirmation gates between each. AINE's `aws-app-builder` 18-layer references and AgentCore deployment guides remain available â€” AI-DLC's design stages can call them by name (e.g., 'Read aws-app-builder/references/layer-6-ai-agents.md before designing the agent'). Expect a multi-day flow with frequent gates."
2. Construct the kickoff prompt. Suggest:

   > "Using AI-DLC, advance to Construction for the units defined in Inception."

   Ask the FDE to confirm or adjust.
3. Wait for the FDE to type or confirm the prompt. AI-DLC's rules take over.
4. **Do not interfere** with AI-DLC's per-unit loop. Each unit completes fully (design + code) before the next begins. Each stage requires explicit user confirmation. The agent's role is to follow AI-DLC's rules and to surface AINE references when the AI-DLC design stages call for them.
5. **Reference handoff convention.** When AI-DLC's design stages need a specific AINE layer reference, the agent reads from `<engagement>/.kiro/references/aws-app-builder/` (Kiro path) or the equivalent platform path. The agent must not paraphrase the references inline â€” AI-DLC's content-validation rules require accurate reproduction of any cited material.
6. Watch for AI-DLC's "Build and Test" stage completion. At that point AI-DLC's Construction is done.
7. **Mirror state.** Update `state/current.yaml`:
   - `currentStage: transform`
8. Append a decision entry to `state/history.jsonl`:
   ```json
   {
     "ts":"<iso>",
     "actor":"fde",
     "kind":"aidlc-construction-complete",
     "detail":{
       "artifactsAt":"aidlc-docs/construction/",
       "buildAndTestAt":"aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/",
       "evidence":{
         "source":"aidlc-audit",
         "auditPath":"aidlc-docs/audit.md",
         "auditTimestamp":"<iso from audit log>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
9. Write the construction-kickoff receipt at `artifacts/aws-aidlc/construction-kickoff-{timestamp}.md` linking to the AI-DLC construction artifacts.
10. **Re-resolve and re-render (MANDATORY).** After advancing to `transform` stage:
    - Call `aine_patch_intention` to update the intention with any new information gathered during Construction (e.g., appLevel confirmed, workload type confirmed).
    - Call `aine_resolve` to re-evaluate program activation. Programs gated to `transform` stage (e.g., `resilience`, `ai-operations`, `agentpath`) may now activate.
    - Call `aine_render` to write newly-activated program steering and skills into `.kiro/steering/` and `.kiro/skills/`.
    - Report to the FDE which programs were added.


10. **Re-resolve and re-render (MANDATORY).** After advancing to `transform` stage:
    - Call `aine_patch_intention` to update the intention with any new information gathered during Construction (e.g., appLevel confirmed, workload type confirmed).
    - Call `aine_resolve` to re-evaluate program activation. Programs gated to `transform` stage (e.g., `resilience`, `ai-operations`, `agentpath`) may now activate based on updated intake fields.
    - Call `aine_render` with the engagement directory to write newly-activated program steering and skills into `.kiro/steering/` and `.kiro/skills/`.
    - Report to the FDE which programs were added.

11. Tell the FDE: "Construction is complete. Programs have been re-resolved for the transform stage. Run `/aidlc-operations` to complete AI-DLC's Operations phase."

## Done when

- `aidlc-docs/construction/**` exists with at least one unit completed.
- `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/` exists.
- AI-DLC's `aidlc-state.md` shows Construction phase as complete.
- AINE's `state/history.jsonl` has an `aidlc-construction-complete` decision entry.
- `currentStage` advanced to `transform`.

## Anti-patterns this skill rejects

- **Calling Construction before Inception is signed off.** Pre-flight refuses.
- **Calling Construction without AINE intake synced.** Downstream programs (RAI, AIM) cannot read from `aidlc-docs/` directly; they need the `state.intake.*` mirrors.
- **Generating a competing Kiro spec at `.kiro/specs/<workload>/{requirements,design,tasks}.md`.** When AI-DLC drives Construction, the Kiro three-file spec is **not** produced. The bridge says: AI-DLC's design tree is the source of truth. The `aws-app-builder` program's `app-spec-created` exit criterion is satisfied via a pointer artifact, not a parallel spec.
